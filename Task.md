### Brief

Create new React Native app. This app needs to display the top 100 songs based on the iTunes API.

### Tasks

- Show top 100 albums based on the json feed here: `https://itunes.apple.com/us/rss/topalbums/limit=100/json`
- A clean modern look
- A good user experience
- Allow the top 100 to be searchable
- Additional features that you think would work well here (for example, advanced search, integration with other API, a "Favorite" functionality)

### Evaluation Criteria

- **React Native** best practices
- Show us your work through your commit history
- Completeness: did you complete the features?
- Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
- Maintainability: is it written in a clean, maintainable way?
- Testing: is the system adequately tested?
